_A small library for controlling Parallax PING))) Ultrasonic Rangefinders_

by Mike Green (mike.is.green[at]gmail[dot]com)

## Summary

I started writing this library during a bit of a building spree that died off a while ago. I never actually got it working, and it's languished here for quite some time. But I've resolved to get it working.

This library represents my first attempt at writing reusable C++ code, so it's gonna be rought. But its domain is also pretty simple, since the PING))) has an onboard controller that handles all the gritty details of its operation. All this library needs to do is send signals to the attached PING))) and receive its calculations.

## Usage

Usage info will follow, once I get the library working.
